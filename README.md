# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

This weeks challenge tasked learners with creating a quiz. The quiz dynamically creates HTML elements and attributes when clicking through. All whilst deducting time from the timer if the user were to get a question wrong. Once you the user has reached the end of the quiz, they will be given an option to store their initials along with a timestamp of how long it took to complete the quiz. After, they have the option to clear scores, and move back to the beginning of the quiz and try again.
